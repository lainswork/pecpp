# Introduction

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This is a passion/hobby project of mine that turned out to be quite useful beyond what I initially anticipated. It is also very much a work-in-progress. To that end, contributions in the form of pull requests, issues, and code reviews are most welcome.

### How to report a bug

Please create an issue with any relevant commit information, a brief description of the bug (what happens, where it is encountered, etc), and mark the issue with the `bug` label.

## Feature request

If you have an idea for a feature request, please create an issue with the `enhancement` label, and a fitting description and title for your idea.

## Code Reviews

As this is a C++ hobby project, its highly likely that in the initial commits I've made at least a few grievous C++ mistakes. I am very welcome to any review of the code for security issues or otherwise. Please submit code reviews in the form of issues with the `code review` label.

## Pull Requests

#### License

Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License. In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same MIT License that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

#### Rules

1. Please create an issue with either the `bug` or `enhancement` labels (and any other labels that may apply) before creating a pull request (unless the issue is extremely minor, such as a typo in documentation).
2. Please create a local branch with a descriptive name for all contributions. Please prefix all branch names with:
    - `fix` for bug fixes, 
    - `feat` for features and enhancements, 
    - `test` for testing change or additions, 
    - `refactor` for code refactoring & cleanup.
    - `doc` for documentation related changes

#### Style Guide

- Capitalize class names (e.g. `Image`)
- Use `snake_case` for variables and functions
- Prefer smaller functions
- Avoid raw pointers (especially `void *` and its ilk)

## Set-up Instructions

This project uses Git, CMake, and C++20. Please make sure to have these installed before working on the code base.

## First Contributions

As this is a hobby project of mine, there are lots of ideas I have for features and fixes that I just don't have time to get around to implementing myself. As such, there are several `help wanted` labelled issues that would make good starting points for first contributions.
